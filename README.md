# My own thoughts and experience with PrincetonAlgorithms in Coursera

The homework of https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1 Princeton Algorithms tutorial Part1

It is just not enough to listen the lecture, you have to follow the lecturers' ideas and dive into their thoughts and implement those algorithms
presented by this course.

There is no need to simulate the algorithm given by Robert and Kevin, just learn their ideas and write your own code. They usually have some test
program to check your answer.

In the beginning don't be afraid of got puzzled by the question, just review the lecture slides again, and maybe you can google the question and
learn from other people's code. The key point is realize the thoughts, deduction or whatever you call it, and put it in your own code.

Remember to review or write again of the previous content and question, and a better way is to share this algorithm open course to your friends,
it is actually kind of fun to dive into the ocean of algorithm.
